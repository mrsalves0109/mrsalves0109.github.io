<h3>While the number of children who’s growth have been stunted due to malnutrition<br> has slowed, the numbers are still shocking.  Over 149 million children around the <br>world are not getting the nutrients they need for their bodies to grow.  Effects of <br>malnutrition in children can last their whole lives.  These children can suffer severe irreversible physical and cognitive damage in addition to being more susceptible to infections. <br>  The poster I created shows the difference in standard deviations  between <br>a normal child and one who’s growth has been stunted.
