<h3> The final I created for my Animations class is based on N64's FZeroX game.  I created my very own course based on the first course in the game called Jack City. <br>  My course is set in a  futuristic version of New York City with the Freedom tower and Flatiron Building off in the distance. <br> Enjoy.
